This crate provides a no_std driver for the AXP192 power management IC, commonly used in M5Stack devices and other embedded systems. The project aims to support the full functionality of the AXP192 PMIC, leveraging the device-driver crate with a declarative YAML manifest (device.yaml) for a robust, type-safe register map definition. The low-level API covers 100% of the AXP192's registers, with device.yaml providing a comprehensive and accurate description of all registers and their fields. While the low-level API is complete, some high-level convenience methods for easier access may still be added in the future.

## Overview

The `axp192-dd` driver offers:

- **Declarative Configuration:** The AXP192 register map is defined in [`device.yaml`](device.yaml), enabling `device-driver` to generate a type-safe, low-level register access API. This approach enhances maintainability and extensibility.
- **Flexible Operation Modes:** Supports both asynchronous (`async/await`) and blocking I2C communication via feature flags. The [`bisync`](https://github.com/okhsunrog/bisync) crate provides a unified API, reducing code duplication.
- **High-Level and Low-Level APIs:**
  - High-level methods simplify tasks like setting DC-DC/LDO voltages, reading ADC voltages.
  - Low-level API (via the `ll` field of the `Axp192` struct) offers direct, type-safe access to all registers defined in `device.yaml` via raw values or enums.
- **Peripheral Control:** Manages DC-DCs, LDOs, GPIOs, ADC conversions, interrupts, and power settings.
- **`no_std` and `no-alloc`:** Optimized for bare-metal and RTOS environments.
- **Optional Logging:** Supports `defmt` and the `log` facade for debugging.

## ⚠️ Warning! ⚠️

**Caution!** The AXP192 controls power to the microcontroller and critical components. Incorrect configuration may cause malfunctions, data loss, or hardware damage.

- **Always consult the official AXP192 datasheet** (see [Datasheet](#datasheet)) before modifying power settings.
- Verify voltage and current limits for your device and components.
- Exercise caution when adjusting output voltages or charging parameters.
- The authors are not liable for damage caused by misuse.

## Features

- **Declarative Register Map:** Defined in `device.yaml`.
- **Async/Await Support:** Enabled by the `async` feature with `embedded-hal-async`.
- **Blocking Support:** Enabled by the `blocking` feature with `embedded-hal`.
- **Unified API with `bisync`:** Shared logic for async and blocking modes.
- **Type-Safe Register Access:** Generated by `device-driver`.
- **Comprehensive Control:** (See `device.yaml` for details)
  - DC-DC and LDO voltage/enable.
  - Battery charging and status.
  - ADC readings (voltages, currents, temperature).
  - GPIO configuration.
  - Interrupt management.
  - Power key (PEK) parameters.
- **`no_std` and `no-alloc`**.
- **Optional Logging:** Supports `defmt` and `log` facade.

## Getting Started

1. **Add `axp192-dd` to `Cargo.toml`:**

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   axp192-dd = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["async"] } # Or "blocking"
   embedded-hal-async = "1.0.0" # If using async feature
   # Or
   embedded-hal = "1.0.0" # If using blocking feature
   ```

   **Note:** Other dependencies required by `axp192-dd` are managed internally and do not need to be added manually.

2. **Instantiate the driver with your I2C bus:**

   ```rust
   use axp192_dd::{Axp192, LdoId};
   #[cfg(feature = "blocking")] {
   use embedded_hal::i2c::I2c;

   pub struct MyI2cBus;

   struct MyI2cError;

   impl I2c for MyI2cBus {
       type Error = MyI2cError;

       fn transaction(&mut self, _a: u8, _o: &mut [embedded_hal::i2c::Operation<'_>]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
         todo!() }
   }

   # initialize
   let i2c_bus_impl = MyI2cBus;
   let mut axp = Axp192::new(i2c_bus_impl);
   axp.set_ldo_voltage_mv(LdoId::Ldo2, 3300)?;
   # returns:  Ok::<(), axp192_dd::AxpError<MyI2cError>>(())
   ```

   Methods are `async fn` with the `async` feature, otherwise blocking.

## Examples

Examples for ESP32-C3 using [Rust on ESP](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/) and `esp-hal` are included. Setup is required (see [esp-hal docs](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/)).

- **Async Example:** [`examples/test_pmic_async.rs`](examples/test_pmic_async.rs)
  ```bash
  cargo run --release --example test_pmic_async --features async,defmt
  ```
- **Blocking Example:** [`examples/test_pmic_blocking.rs`](examples/test_pmic_blocking.rs)
  ```bash
  cargo run --release --example test_pmic_blocking --features blocking,defmt
  ```

## Register Map

The AXP192 register map is defined in [`device.yaml`](device.yaml), which `device-driver` uses to generate Rust code. This file specifies:

- Register names, addresses, and sizes.
- Field names, bit positions, and access modes (Read-Only, Read-Write, Write-1-Clear).
- Enumerations for field values (e.g., charging currents, voltage settings).
- Reset values and descriptions based on the datasheet.

Access the low-level API via `axp.ll` (e.g., `axp.ll.power_status().read()`). High-level methods provide convenient access to common features.

## Supported Devices

The AXP192 is used in devices including:

- [M5Stack Core 2](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/core2) (and [Core 2 for AWS](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/core2_for_aws))
- [M5Stack Tough](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/tough)

## Feature Flags

- **`default = []`**: No default features; explicitly select `async` or `blocking`.
- **`async`**: Enables async operation with `embedded-hal-async`.
- **`blocking`**: Enables blocking operation with `embedded-hal`.
  - _Note:_ `async` and `blocking` are mutually exclusive.
- **`std`**: Enables `std` features for `thiserror`.
- **`log`**: Enables `log` facade logging. Requires `log = { version = "0.4", optional = true }`.
- **`defmt`**: Enables `defmt` logging. Requires `defmt = { version = "1.0", optional = true }`.
